# Navigating Data

We've given you a big old piece of data in this workshop. Your challenge is to navigate it.

Data is the real world can be gnarly at times, and can feel unmanageable. But, as always, if we break it down and approach it systematically it is completely doable!

## Files

The files you need to care about are for this workshop are:

- `index.html` - this is your HTML file, and won't need editing
- `main.js` - this is where all of your JavaScript will go

## Tasks

The tasks are outlined in `main.js` - complete them as instructed. Remember to use computational thinking always! Especially:

- Understand the problem
- Break down into smaller problems
